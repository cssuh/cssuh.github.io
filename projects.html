				<a href="https://github.com/cssuh/SlidingPuzzle" target="_blank"><b>Sliding Puzzle</b></a> - 
				Created a sliding puzzle application that mimics the classic 
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle" target="_blank">15 Puzzle</a> game.  We were provided with 
				the front-end implementation and implemented the backend of this project.
			</p>

			<p>
				<a href="https://github.com/cssuh/MazeGame" target="_blank"><b>Maze Game</b></a> - 
				Built the backend for a maze game given the GUI and one generation algorithm.  The code base was from Paul Falstad 
				(falstad.com) and was refactored by my professor for educational purposes.  Implemented Kruskal's and Prim's maze 
				building algorithms.  Additionally, we later ported this Java desktop applicaiton to an Android application.
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="https://github.com/Khauri/politix" target="_blank"><b>Politix</b></a> - 
				A desktop application built with my team using Javascript at the <a href="http://www.disruptdc.io/" target="_blank">
				Distrupt the District Hackathon</a> where we were finalists.  This application is aimed towards defeating 
				political apathy in young adults.
			</p>
			<p>				
				<a href="https://github.com/Khauri/blessed-charlotte" target="_blank"><b>Charlotte Webcrawler</b></a> - 
				A configurable, developer-friendly and user-friendly  data scraper packaged as a chrome extension that was 
				developed with my team at the <a href="http://hackathon.dominionenterprises.com/" target="_blank">
				Dominion Enterprises Hackathon</a>.  It will return scraped data as a csv file.
