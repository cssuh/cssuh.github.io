		<p><a href="https://github.com/cssuh/SlidingPuzzle" target="_blank"><b>Sliding Puzzle</b></a> - Created a sliding puzzle application that mimics the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle" target="_blank">15 Puzzle</a> game.  We were provided with the front-end implementation and implemented the backend of this project.</p>

		<p><a href="https://github.com/cssuh/MazeGame" target="_blank"><b>Maze Game</b></a> - Built the backend for a maze game given the GUI and one generation algorithm.  The code base was from Paul Falstad (falstad.com) and was refactored by my professor for educational purposes.  Implemented Kruskal's and Prim's maze building algorithms.  Additionally, we later ported this Java desktop applicaiton to an Android application.</p>
